'''Python Variables - Assign Multiple Values

Python allows you to assign values to multiple variables in one line:
EX
x,y,z ="orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)

One Value to Multiple Variables
means  you can assign the same value to multiple variables in one line:
x = y = z = "Orange"
print(x)
print(y)
print(z)
--------------------------------------------------------------
Python - out variables
The Python print() function is often used to output variables.
Ex 
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)
In the print() function, you output multiple variables, separated by a comma:
Example
x = "Python"
y = "is"
z = "awesome"
print(x, y, z)

The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, 
which even support different data types:
Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
