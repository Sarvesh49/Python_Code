''' Python Variables
WAHT IS VARIABLES
Variables are containers for storing data values.
a=1

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
EXample
x= 5.2
y= "hello world!"
z= 'A'

* Creating Variables
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
Example
x=1
y="Max"
print(x) # x is of type int
print(y) # x is now of type str

* Single or Double Quotes?
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

variables are case sensitve
Ex
a =4
A="sally" # A will not overwrite a 

Python Variable Names

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
1 A variable name cannot start with a number
2 A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
3 Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
4 A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

legal variables names:
myvar = "Max"
my_var = "Max"
_my_var = "Max"
myVar = "Max"
MYVAR = "Max"
myvar2 = "Max"

* Multi Words Variable Names
Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.
There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

1 Camel Case
Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:
Ex myVariableName = "MAX"

2 Pascal Case
Each word starts with a capital letter:
Ex MyVariableName = "John"
