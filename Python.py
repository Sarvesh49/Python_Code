'''          Python Introduction
What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

1 web development (server-side),
2 software development,
3 mathematics,
4 system scripting.

* What can Python do?
1 Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
2 Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
3 Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
4 Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
5 Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.

* python is interpreted  
Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written.
or you can say it exceute your code line by line. 

* Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
1 Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
2 Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
3 Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.

To check python version
C:/Users/Your Name>python --version
                OR
If it doesn't work type py --version

* FLAVOURS OF PYTHON
CPython. It is the standard flavor of Python. 
Jython OR JPython. It is for Java Applications. 
IronPython. It is for C#.Net platform.
PyPy. The main advantage of PyPy is performance will be improved because JIT compiler is available inside PVM.
RubyPython. For Ruby Platforms.
AnacondaPython.

Python Keywords
there are 33 keywords in python3
 the keywords except True, False and None are in lowercase and they must be written as they are. 
These cannot be used as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers.
If any of the keywords is used as a variable, then we will get the error message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
False	def 	 if	            raise
None	del	     import	        return
True	elif	 in	            try
and	    else	 is	            while
as	    except	 lambda	        with
assert	finally	  nonlocal  	yield
break	for	      not
class	form	  or
continue	global	pass

What is PVM in Python?
Python Virtual Machine (PVM) is a program which provides programming environment.
The role of PVM is to convert the byte code instructions into machine code
so the computer can execute those machine code instructions and display the output.
